## How to use this document

This readme file contains my notes on the fundamental concepts of the Pascal Programming Language

Within the LearnPascal repository, there are files which contain my source code around putting Pascal into practice. 

Fundamentals 1 - 3 contain the basics such as printing messages, arthmetic, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, procedures etc.

There will be further programs added in due course which puts the fundamentals into practice such as a Mortgage Calculator.

The aim is to ideally create:

* 3-5 Basic Programs
* 2-3 Medium Difficulty Programs 
* 1 Difficult Program

## Introduction

Pascal is a procedural, general purpose programming language, designed in 1968 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth and named in honour of the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. Pascal runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and various versions of UNIX/Linux.

Pascal is Algol-based language and includes many constructs of Algol. Algol 60 is a subset of Pascal. Pascal offers several data types and programming structures. It is easy to understand and maintain the Pascal programs.

## Pascal has grown in popularity in the teaching and academics arena for various reasons:

* Easy to learn.
* Structured language.
* It produces transparent, efficient and reliable programs.
* It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
* Features of the Pascal Language 

## Pascal has the following features

* Pascal is a strongly typed language.
* It offers extensive error checking.
* It offers several data types like arrays, records, files and sets.
* It offers a variety of programming structures.
* It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.
* It supports object oriented programming. 

## Facts about Pascal

* Pascal is based on the block structured style of the Algol programming language.
* Pascal was developed as a language suitable for teaching programming as a systematic discipline, whose implementations could be both reliable and efficient.
* Pascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Mac.
* In 1986, Apple Computer released the first Object Pascal implementation, and in 1993, the Pascal Standards Committee published an Object-Oriented Extension to Pascal.
 

## Why to use Pascal?

Pascal allows the programmers to define complex structured data types and build dynamic and recursive data structures, such as lists, trees and graphs. Pascal offers features like records, enumerations, subranges, dynamically allocated variables with associated pointers and sets. 

Pascal allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth. This truly provides a great programming environment for learning programming as a systematic discipline based on the fundamental concepts. 

### Some examples of implementations of Pascal are: 

* Skype
* Total Commander
* TeX
* Macromedia Captivate
* Apple Lisa
* Various PC Games
* Embedded Systems

## Program Structure

The following is a review of a bare minimum Pascal program structure:

### Pascal Program Structure 

A Pascal program basically consists of the following parts −

* Program name
* Uses command
* Type declarations
* Constant declarations
* Variables declarations
* Functions declarations
* Procedures declarations
* Main program block
* Statements and Expressions within each block
* Comments
 
Every pascal program generally has a heading statement, a declaration and an execution part strictly in that order. 

Following format shows the basic syntax for a Pascal program −
