# Exploring Strings, String Variables and String Functions/Procedures

The purpose of this program was to explore Strings in Delphi.

I explored some of the most common String functions and procedures such as:

* Length
* Concat
* IntToStr
* UpperCase
* LowerCase
* Trim
* Copy
* Insert
* Pos
* Copy
* Delete
* String Replace

The program uses a form which displays different Pangrams. Using the functions and procedures above, the program manipulates Pangrams. These are particulary useful in the work environment as input from users may need to be amended before processing.

Within the program I also practiced linking two forms together where an additional form pops up to ask for additional information.

Some screen shots can be seen below:
