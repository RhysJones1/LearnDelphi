# Working with Databases in Delphi

The following folder focuses on working with databases in delphi.

The program works with a basic customer database using MS Access

The program accesses the database and using a VCL form, the user can search for their username. If their name is within the database they get their ID number.
If they are not in the database, they recieve a message stating that their details could not be found.

For it to work on your PC, you will need to connect the database file with the ADO Database.
