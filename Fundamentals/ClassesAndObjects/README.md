# Classes and Objects 
We can imagine our universe made of different objects like sun, earth, moon, etc. Similarly, we can imagine our car made of different objects like wheel, steering, gear, etc. Same way, there are object-oriented programming concepts, which assume everything as an object and implement a software using different objects. In Pascal, there are two structural data types used to implement a real world object −

- Object types
- Class types

Object-Oriented Concepts

Before we go in detail, let's define important Pascal terms related to Object-Oriented Pascal.

* **Object** − An Object is an instance of a classes. It possesses state and behaviour, where state comes from the data it holds and the behaviour comes from the methods that it carries. 

* **Class** − A Class is a essentially the blueprint from which objects are created. They can contain fields and methods from which objects inherit and provide a starting state. Objects then manipulate the data provided in order to create a unique state. In delphi, they begin with T for example, ```TButton``` 

* **Attributes:** How an object looks and feels. These are done through fields

* **Behaviour:** How the object behaves and maniplulates it's state. These are done through methods, functions or procedures

* **Instantiation of a class** − Instantiation means creating an instance of the class known as objects  

* **Member Variables** − These are the variables defined inside a Class or an Object.

* **Member Functions**− These are the functions or procedures defined inside a Class or an Object and are used to access object data.

* **Visibility of Members** − The members of an Object or Class are also called the fields. These fields have different visibilities. Visibility refers to accessibility of the members, i.e., exactly where these members will be accessible. Objects have three visibility levels: public, private and protected. Classes have five visibility types: public, private, strictly private, protected and published. We will discuss visibility in details.

* **Inheritance** − When a Class is defined by inheriting existing functionalities of a parent Class, then it is said to be inherited. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class. Objects can also be inherited.

* **Polymorphism** − This is an object-oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example, function name will remain same but it may take different number of arguments and can do different tasks. Pascal classes implement polymorphism. Objects do not implement polymorphism.

* **Overloading** − It is a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Similarly functions can also be overloaded with different implementation. Pascal classes implement overloading, but the Objects do not.

* **Data Abstraction** − Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).

* **Encapsulation** − Refers to a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.

* **Constructor** − Refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class or an Object.

* **Destructor** − Refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an Object or Class is deleted or goes out of scope.
