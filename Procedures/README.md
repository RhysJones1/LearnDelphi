# Procedures & VCL

The following folder contains a source code to procedures that I have written.

Here, the aim is to not only practice writing procedures but also to get comfortable with creating forms to work along side the code written.

Three procedures have been created:

* Generate a generic heading and display in the memo
* User writes a custom header of choice which displays on memo
* Text file gets uploaded into memo
